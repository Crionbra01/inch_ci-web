# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    headline: "What is Inch CI?"
    abstract: |
      This project is an attempt to raise the visibility of code documentation in Ruby. It provides badges to include in your project's README, to show people that documenting code is a cool thing.

      The badges are based on Inch and look like this:
      ![Inline docs](/assets/badge-example.png)
       Get yours below!

      ## What is Inch?

      Inch is a documentation measurement tool for Ruby that was created to help people document their code.
      It is a command-line utility that gives grades based on how complete the docs are ([screenshots](http://trivelop.de/inch)).

      ## What is the goal?

      I really think that posting these badges in a project's README will benefit the project (because people can see that it's well documented) and the community by improving the visibility of documentation.

      Let's start a discussion, let's raise the visibility of documentation, let's talk.

      ## Wait, who's behind this?

      I'm [@rrrene](https://twitter.com/rrrene), creator of [sparkr](http://trivelop.de/sparkr) and [Inch](http://trivelop.de/inch).
