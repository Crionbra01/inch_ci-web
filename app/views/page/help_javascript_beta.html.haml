        ## Let's raise the visibility of documentation in JavaScript!

        The plan is for Inch CI to get JavaScript support in February. This might prove a challenge, since there aren't alot of structural similarities to Ruby and Elixir.

        This is where you come in:

        * To help me build the best Inch for JavaScript, ***<a href="https://github.com/inch-ci/inch_ci-web/edit/master/add_my_project_to_inch_ci.yml" style="text-decoration: underline">edit this list via GitHub</a>*** and add your project.
        * ***Tweet about it***, mentioning ["@InchCI for JavaScript"](https://twitter.com/InchCI), encouraging others to join in our quest to help make inline-docs better in JS.
        * By doing so, you are so-to-speak "joining the private beta of Inch CI for JavaScript". [1]
        * ***I will create a badge for you*** and evaluate your project with the InchJS release candidate.
        * You get access to these badges before the general public (as a "thank you").
        * We can discuss ***how to make the evaluation better/more fair***.

        That's the plan.

        <small>[1] Okay, technically you could always wait for the finished integration, but hey, think about what Open Source is all about: collaboration and community, getting the word out and being among the first to try new stuff.</small>
