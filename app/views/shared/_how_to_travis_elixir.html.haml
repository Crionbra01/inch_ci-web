  ## How-to get your Elixir docs badge

  To add your project to Inch CI, you have to include `inch_ex` in your dependencies in the `mix.exs` file:

      defp deps do
        [{:inch_ex, only: docs}]
      end

  Your `.travis.yml` might look something like this:

      language: erlang
      otp_release:
        - 17.1
      before_install:
        - wget http://s3.hex.pm/builds/elixir/v1.0.0.zip
        - unzip -d elixir v1.0.0.zip
      before_script:
        - export PATH=`pwd`/elixir/bin:$PATH
        - mix local.hex --force
        - mix deps.get --only test
      script: mix test

  Simply add the following at the end of the file:

      after_script:
        - MIX_ENV=docs mix deps.get
        - MIX_ENV=docs mix inch.report

  What this does is that your docs are evaluated at the end of your next Travis build.

  Travis sends a report to Inch CI which then displays the results here (and generates a new badge).
