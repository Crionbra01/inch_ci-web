    Returns a sparkline

    Example:

      list = [open_issue_count, closed_issue_count]
      Sparkr.sparkline(list)
      # => "▁█"

    Example with block:

    Let's say you have your list of open and closed issues, but you
    want to format it so the open ones are red and the closed ones are
    green, so you can quickly see how you are doing. Let's further
    suppose you use a gem that adds a #color method to String
    for ANSI coloring.

      line = Sparkr.sparkline(list) do |tick, count, index|
        if index == 0
          tick.color(:red)
        else
          tick.color(:green)
        end
      end

      line
      # => "▁█" (colored, trust me)

    @param numbers [Array<String, Fixnum, Float>] the numbers to be rendered
    @param &block [Proc] optional, can be used to format the rendered string

    @return [String]
